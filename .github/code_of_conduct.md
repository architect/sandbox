# Introduction
By participating and contributing to the Small Wins (aka Begin) community -- including, but not limited to its open source projects, any related online venues such as Github, Slack, in-person events, etc. -- you agree to this Code of Conduct. Lack of familiarity with this Code of Conduct is not an excuse for not adhering to it.

## What we actively work towards
- Creating and maintaining a safe, positive, inclusive community

- Being excellent to each other


## Prohibited behavior
What that means in practice is zero tolerance for behavior and communication that includes, but is not limited to:
- Harassment

- Threats or intimidation of any kind
- Stalking and excessive attention (including photography or recording)

This may come in the form of language, imagery, or other forms of communication, and may be in person or online.


# Reporting
If you are the subject of any behavior prohibited by this Code of Conduct, or observe someone who is, please contact a Begin team member immediately.

If you know a Begin team member, you may wish to contact them personally (and you should); but if not, please [contact us via email](mailto:conduct@begin.com).

If possible, please attempt to collect any relevant information and evidence, including links, screenshots, or other recordings of any incident.

Reports will be handled with the utmost care, confidence, and sensitivity towards the individual(s) reporting.


# Enforcement
Should incidents arise, upon adjudication those found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct may be immediately expelled from the Begin community.


## Policy precedence
This version of the Begin Community Code of Conduct may be a copy included for your convenience, and as such may not be up to date; all versions of the Begin Community Code of Conduct are superseded by the version found in the [Begin Policy archive](https://github.com/smallwins/policy), which takes precedence over any prior versions.
