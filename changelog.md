- Sending a message to a `connectionId` before it has connected should emit a `GoneException`
- h/t @andybee for helping track this down üîç

----

## [1.10.0] 2020-05-17

### Added

- Adds Yarn support for hydration
- Improved default caching behavior for static assets; fixes #273
  - Any assets that don't have `cache-control` explicitly set will now default to using `ETag` in order to improve the reliability of cache invalidation
  - HTML & JSON responses still default to anti-caching headers
- Added path peeking (aka pretty URLs)
  - Example: to load `/foo/index.html`, you used to have to request `/foo/`
- Added ETag support to Sandbox static asset serving

### Fixed

- Fixed `ERR_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE_ON_PLATFORM` error in Node.js 14; fixes #780, ht @stegosource

---

## [1.9.6] 2020-04-22

### Added

- Adds support for `multiValueHeaders` in response object; fixes #764, thanks @andybee!


### Fixed

- Fixed `Deno.env()` became `Deno.env.toObject()` for the impending 1.x release

---

## [1.9.5] 2020-04-18

### Fixed

- Updated dependency status checker, fixes false positive rehyhdration of packages installed by archive or git repo

---

## [1.9.4] 2020-04-16

### Added

- Added Sandbox watcher pausing
  - The presence of `_pause-architect-sandbox-watcher` in your operating system's `$TMP` directory (usually `/tmp` or `c:\windows\temp`) will temporarily pause the Sandbox watcher
  - This is useful when combined with tools like `lint-staged` to ensure automated file stashing within `src/shared` and `src/views` doesn't result in hydration failures
  - Sandbox cleans up this file on startup, jic


### Changed

- Improved missing dependency warning to provide better instructions on how to install a missing dependency if the function in question does not already have a `package.json` file; /ht @exalted


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where explicit (or empty) returns would provide a red herring error
- When a non-existent `@events` Lambda is invoked, Sandbox will now gracefully fail

---

## [1.9.3] 2020-04-08

### Fixed

- Sandbox should now restore the terminal cursor more reliably when quit
- Preserve leading/trailing whitespace from console logging
- Fixed issue where `.arc-config` files with an `@aws timeout` value of exactly `900` (15 minutes) would not be respected

---

## [1.9.2] 2020-04-06

### Added

- Adds console logging for uncaught exceptions in async functions in Node.js and Deno; /ht @coco98


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Sandbox should now restore the terminal cursor more reliably when shut down

---

## [1.9.1] 2020-03-31

### Fixed

- Updated the call to start Sandbox in Architect 6 such that it will now actually initiate the filesystem watcher

---


## [1.9.0] 2020-03-29

### Added

- Adds warning for out of bounds dependency loads
  - This helps to ensure that potential side effects of running Node.js locally ‚Äì such as the `require` algorithm traversing the filesystem outside the boundaries of the function in question ‚Äì are less likely to be discovered after deploying to live AWS infra

---

## [1.8.2 - 1.8.3] 2020-03-24

### Added

- Lambda's payload size limits are now respected and mocked; payloads exceeding 6MB will fail to execute, as they would in AWS


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixes issue where HTTP requests with large body payloads error with E2BIG; fixes #639, /ht @dawnerd

---

## [1.8.1] 2020-03-22

### Changed

- Minor improvements to auto-generated boilerplate function files
- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- `.arc-env` env vars now support a wider variety of special characters (such as `+`, `@`, `#`, etc.) if quoted, e.g. `FOO "sp#ci@lch+rs"`; fixes #638
- Fixed Architect project manifest syntax errors and error reporting

---

## [1.8.0] 2020-03-18

### Added

- Added support for running without an existing Architect project manifest


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Query string arrays like `?ids=1&ids=2&ids=3&ids=4` are now consistent with API Gateway's request `multiValueQueryStringParameters` property
  - Previously, the array-like value was available as an object in `request.queryStringParameters` (and `request.query` in Arc 5 mode) which was inconsistent with API Gateway

---

## [1.7.3] 2020-03-17

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.7.2] 2020-02-29

### Added

- Added mocking of AWS's `multiValueHeaders` into `req`
- Also added mocking of the headers AWS drops from requests


### Fixed

- Fixes differences between AWS's inconsistent header casing and our existing lowcase-normalized header casing; fixes #698

---

## [1.7.1] 2020-02-13

### Changed
- Sandbox now ensures `NODE_ENV` is one of `testing`, `staging`, or `production` (defaulting to `testing`)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where pulling changes down with git (or Mercurial) would not trigger filesystem changes; fixes #673
- Improves reliability of using Sandbox with certain test harnesses that may automatically set `NODE_ENV`

---

## [1.7.0] 2020-02-05

### Added

- Added support for running multiple Sandboxes at the same time; fixes #635
  - No more conflicting events and ports when running multiple simultaneous local Architect projects
  - Also, you can now manually configure your `@events` port with `ARC_EVENTS_PORT`, and `@tables` port with `ARC_TABLES_PORT`
  - Note: while unlikely, if you already manually specify your Sandbox's port, this may be a breaking change to your local workflow in two circumstances:
    - 1) You use Architect Functions; to fix, upgrade to Functions `3.6` or later
    - 2) You hardcode an `@events` client to port `3334` or DynamoDB client to port `5000`; you should now read the ports from `ARC_EVENTS_PORT` and `ARC_TABLES_PORT`
    - This change is **NOT breaking to any live AWS / production infra**

---

## [1.6.1] 2020-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed AWS credential instantiation to ensure that missing `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars are backfilled with dummy values in scenarios where valid credentials are not required

---

## [1.6.0] 2020-02-02

### Added

- Better support for quiet mode:
  - Via params: `sandbox.start({quiet: true})`
  - Via env vars: `ARC_QUIET` (or legacy `QUIET`)
  - Fixes #621; thanks @konsumer!
- Adds discrete `sandbox.end([callback])` method for shutting down the Sandbox in test environments
  - This method takes an optional callback or returns a promise
- Sandbox now sets the `ARC_CLOUDFORMATION` env var used by Architect Functions and other libs
  - This only occurs when running Sandbox against live infra (specifically: `NODE_ENV` = `staging` || `production`),


### Changed

- When called as module, `sandbox.end` now calls an optional callback or returns a promise; fixes #622, thanks @konsumer!
- Sandbox now only starts the `@events` + `@queues` bus and `@tables` DB when called for by the Architect project manifest


### Fixed

- Improved logging for WebSocket invocations to be less confusing about potential non-error states when message action not found; fixes @sandbox#228
- Fixed potential destructuring bug in `sandbox.start`

---

## [1.5.8] 2020-01-29

### Fixed

### Added

- Sandbox now supports Deno runtime projects!

---

## [1.4.19] 2019-12-12

### Added

- Sandbox now passes full request params from WebSocket clients on `connect` and `disconnect`
  - Now in addition to `request.requestContext.connectionId`, you'll have `request.headers`, and `request.queryStringParameters` (if present)
  - Sandbox now only passes `request.body` to WebSocket functions that receive `message`s (instead of adding an empty `body` object to all requests)


### Changed

- Adds better backwards compatibility support for legacy `src/ws/ws-*` WebSocket function paths

---

## [1.4.18] 2019-12-10

### Added

---

## [1.4.7] 2019-10-14

### Changed

- Legacy WebSockets paths on the filesystem are now formally deprecated
  - Your default three WebSockets paths should be: `src/ws/default`, `src/ws/connect`, `src/ws/disconnect`
  - If you're using legacy WebSockets paths (either `src/ws/ws-default` or `src/ws/ws-$default`), simply remove `ws-[$]` and you should be all set!

---

## [1.4.6] 2019-10-11

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.4 - 1.4.5] 2019-10-10

### Added

- Added support for `@static fingerprint true` in root spa / proxy requests
  - Also includes support for build-free calls between your fingerprinted static assets
    - Example: in `public/index.html`, use the following syntax to automatically replace the local / human-friendly filename reference to the deployed fingerprinted filename:
    - `${arc.static('image.png')}` will be automatically replaced by `image-a1c3e5.png`
    - Or `${STATIC('image.png')}` (which is the same thing, but shoutier)
    - Note: although those look like JS template literal placeholders, they're intended to live inside non-executed, static files within `public/` (or `@static folder foo`)


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixes

- Fixes root spa / proxy requests when Architect and/or Sandbox are globally installed; resolves #92 /ht @grahamb

---

## [1.4.1 - 1.4.3] 2019-09-29

### Added

- Startup auto-hydration now hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- When auto-hydrating functions upon startup, `sandbox` no longer hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared` with each function

---

## [1.4.0] 2019-09-26

### Added

- Auto-hydration received a bunch of nice upgrades:
  - Auto-hydration now detects changes to the state of your installed Node dependencies, and rehydrates if necessary; for example:
    - You're working on a project, and a teammate updates a dependency in `get /foo` from version `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`
    - Upon your next git pull, `sandbox` will detect the dependency update in `get /foo` and automatically install version `1.1.0` for you
  - Auto-hydration now has a rate limit of one change every 500ms to prevent recursive or aggressive file updates
  - Auto-hydration now has `@static folder` support
  - Auto-hydration now only hydrates the shared files necessary
    - For example: if you change a file in `src/views`, it will only update your `@views` functions, and not attempt to rehydrate all your project's functions with `src/shared`
  - Events now have a timestamp and improved formatting
- Beta: `sandbox` init script support!
  - `sandbox` will now run the init script of your choosing upon startup after all subsystems have started up:
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.js` - a CommonJS module, receives your parsed Arc project as a parameter, supports async/await
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.py` - a Python script
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.rb` - a Ruby script


### Changed

- Improvements to auto-hydration of `src/shared` and `src/views` upon startup
- Improvements to the conditions under which the HTTP server starts, shuts down, and restarts; fixes #65
- Improved async error copy (displayed when execution does not complete)
- Proxied requests now sends a proper `req.resource`, which can resolve some SPA bugs, esp when used with newer Arc Functions
- `sandbox` now respects and errors on invalid response params for proper Architect 6 compatibility; fixes #49
- Updates Dynalite to `3.0.0`, thanks @mhart!
- Better 404 / file missing handling in `sandbox` when using `http.proxy` (or loading assets without `@http get /` specified)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where in certain circumstances `get /` wouldn't reload after a change to the project manifest
- Minor fix where if you specified a `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` env var outside of `.arc-env`, `sandbox` won't clobber it
- Fixed caching headers for various error states (async, timeout, etc.) to ensure your browser won't accidentally cache an error response

---

## [1.3.14] 2019-09-16

### Changed

- Internal change: moves vendored HTTP proxy bundle into node module
- This change incorporates a number of fixes by way of `@architect/functions` (see below)


### Fixes

- Fixes issue where binary assets delivered via `sandbox` / root may not be properly encoded
- Fixes issue where `http.proxy.public` + `http.proxy.read` may not have delivered correctly formatted responses in an Architect 5 environment

---

## [1.3.13] 2019-09-15

### Fixed

- Fixes callback error when auto-rehydrating `src/shared` and `src/views`

---
