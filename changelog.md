# Architect Sandbox changelog

---

## [1.4.0] 2019-09-26

### Added

- Auto-hydration received a bunch of nice upgrades:
  - Auto-hydration now detects changes to the state of your installed Node dependencies, and rehydrates if necessary; for example:
    - You're working on a project, and a teammate updates a dependency in `get /foo` from version `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`
    - Upon your next git pull, `sandbox` will detect the dependency update in `get /foo` and automatically install version `1.1.0` for you
  - Auto-hydration now has a rate limit of one change every 500ms to prevent recursive or aggressive file updates
  - Auto-hydration now has `@static folder` support
  - Auto-hydration now only hydrates the shared files necessary
    - For example: if you change a file in `src/views`, it will only update your `@views` functions, and not attempt to rehydrate all your project's functions with `src/shared`
  - Events now have a timestamp and improved formatting
- Beta: `sandbox` init script support!
  - `sandbox` will now run the init script of your choosing upon startup after all subsystems have started up:
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.js` - a CommonJS module, receives your parsed Arc project as a parameter, supports async/await
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.py` - a Python script
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.rb` - a Ruby script


### Changed

- Improvements to auto-hydration of src/shared and src/views upon startup
- Improvements to the conditions under which the HTTP server starts, shuts down, and restarts
- Improved async error copy (displayed when execution does not complete)
- Proxied requests now sends a proper `req.resource`, which can resolve some SPA bugs, esp when used with newer Arc Functions
- `sandbox` now respects and errors on invalid response params for proper Architect 6 compatibility, fixes #49
- Updates Dynalite to `3.0.0`, thanks @mhart!
- Better 404 / file missing handling in `sandbox` when using `http.proxy` (or loading assets without `@http get /` specified)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where in certain circumstances `get /` wouldn't reload after a change to the project manifest
- Minor fix where if you specified a `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` env var outside of `.arc-env`, `sandbox` won't clobber it
- Fixed caching headers for various error states (async, timeout, etc.) to ensure your browser won't accidentally cache an error response

---
