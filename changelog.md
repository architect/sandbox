---

## [1.4.19] 2019-12-12

  - Now in addition to `request.requestContext.connectionId`, you'll have `request.headers`, and `request.queryStringParameters` (if present)
  - Sandbox now only passes `request.body` to WebSocket functions that receive `message`s (instead of adding an empty `body` object to all requests)

---

## [1.4.18] 2019-12-10

### Added

---

## [1.4.8 - 1.4.9] 2019-10-15

### Added

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

### Fixed

- Improves error states for missing static configs, 404s, etc. when using `@http` and/or `@static` with `arc.http.proxy` or without defining `get /`

---

## [1.4.7] 2019-10-14

### Changed

- Legacy WebSockets paths on the filesystem are now formally deprecated
  - Your default three WebSockets paths should be: `src/ws/default`, `src/ws/connect`, `src/ws/disconnect`
  - If you're using legacy WebSockets paths (either `src/ws/ws-default` or `src/ws/ws-$default`), simply remove `ws-[$]` and you should be all set!


### Fixed

- Fixed issue when emitting to WebSockets with Arc Functions (`arc.ws.send`); resolves #48, thanks @andybee + @bvkimball!
- Fixed issue where `sandbox` may not have correctly resolved some custom WebSocket actions
- Fixed HTTP request with `body` and no `Content-Type` header; resolves #102, thanks @andybee!
- Fixed issue where killed subprocesses would not trigger timeouts; resolves #30, /ht @mikemaccana

---

## [1.4.6] 2019-10-11

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.4 - 1.4.5] 2019-10-10

### Added

- Added support for `@static fingerprint true` in root spa / proxy requests
  - Also includes support for build-free calls between your fingerprinted static assets
    - Example: in `public/index.html`, use the following syntax to automatically replace the local / human-friendly filename reference to the deployed fingerprinted filename:
    - `${arc.static('image.png')}` will be automatically replaced by `image-a1c3e5.png`
    - Or `${STATIC('image.png')}` (which is the same thing, but shoutier)
    - Note: although those look like JS template literal placeholders, they're intended to live inside non-executed, static files within `public/` (or `@static folder foo`)


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixes

- Fixes root spa / proxy requests when Architect and/or Sandbox are globally installed; resolves #92 /ht @grahamb

---

## [1.4.1 - 1.4.3] 2019-09-29

### Added

- Startup auto-hydration now hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- When auto-hydrating functions upon startup, `sandbox` no longer hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared` with each function

---

## [1.4.0] 2019-09-26

### Added

- Auto-hydration received a bunch of nice upgrades:
  - Auto-hydration now detects changes to the state of your installed Node dependencies, and rehydrates if necessary; for example:
    - You're working on a project, and a teammate updates a dependency in `get /foo` from version `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`
    - Upon your next git pull, `sandbox` will detect the dependency update in `get /foo` and automatically install version `1.1.0` for you
  - Auto-hydration now has a rate limit of one change every 500ms to prevent recursive or aggressive file updates
  - Auto-hydration now has `@static folder` support
  - Auto-hydration now only hydrates the shared files necessary
    - For example: if you change a file in `src/views`, it will only update your `@views` functions, and not attempt to rehydrate all your project's functions with `src/shared`
  - Events now have a timestamp and improved formatting
- Beta: `sandbox` init script support!
  - `sandbox` will now run the init script of your choosing upon startup after all subsystems have started up:
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.js` - a CommonJS module, receives your parsed Arc project as a parameter, supports async/await
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.py` - a Python script
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.rb` - a Ruby script


### Changed

- Improvements to auto-hydration of `src/shared` and `src/views` upon startup
- Improvements to the conditions under which the HTTP server starts, shuts down, and restarts; fixes #65
- Improved async error copy (displayed when execution does not complete)
- Proxied requests now sends a proper `req.resource`, which can resolve some SPA bugs, esp when used with newer Arc Functions
- `sandbox` now respects and errors on invalid response params for proper Architect 6 compatibility; fixes #49
- Updates Dynalite to `3.0.0`, thanks @mhart!
- Better 404 / file missing handling in `sandbox` when using `http.proxy` (or loading assets without `@http get /` specified)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where in certain circumstances `get /` wouldn't reload after a change to the project manifest
- Minor fix where if you specified a `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` env var outside of `.arc-env`, `sandbox` won't clobber it
- Fixed caching headers for various error states (async, timeout, etc.) to ensure your browser won't accidentally cache an error response

---

## [1.3.14] 2019-09-16

### Changed

- Internal change: moves vendored HTTP proxy bundle into node module
- This change incorporates a number of fixes by way of `@architect/functions` (see below)


### Fixes

- Fixes issue where binary assets delivered via `sandbox` / root may not be properly encoded
- Fixes issue where `http.proxy.public` + `http.proxy.read` may not have delivered correctly formatted responses in an Architect 5 environment
