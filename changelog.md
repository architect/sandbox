# Architect Sandbox changelog

---

## [4.5.2] 2022-01-11

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where multi-tenant Lambdas would error on startup

---

## [4.5.0 - 4.5.1] 2022-01-06

### Added

- Added support for Node.js 14 ESM in Lambda!


### Fixed

- Properly invoke Ruby with required keyword params; partial fix for #1291

---

## [4.4.2] 2021-12-01

### Added

- Added `lambdaSrc` propery (mapped from `lambda.src`) to `ARC_SANDBOX` context env var

---

## [4.4.1] 2021-11-22

### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixed HTTP route sorting; however you've organized your `@http` pragma, Sandbox should now behave much more like API Gateway; fixes #977

---

## [4.4.0] 2021-11-16

### Added

- Added support for `@tables-indexes` (which will eventually supersede `@indexes`)
  - For more see: https://arc.codes/tables-indexes


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [4.3.1] 2021-11-13

### Added

- Added internal `ARC_SANDBOX` env var for Sandbox metadata in Lambda invocations


### Fixed

- Fixed upcasing all userland environment variables
- Removed extraneous internal `__ARC*` environment variables from Lambda invocation

---

## [4.3.0] 2021-11-03

### Added

- Sandbox now immediately streams Lambda logs to the console instead of printing everything all at once upon completion of execution; thanks @andybee!
- Added runtime mismatch warnings
  - Example: Sandbox will warn if your `get /foo` Lambda is configured for Python 3.9 and your local machine uses Python 3.8
- Added `runStartupCommands` setting to API options
  - Defaults to `true`; setting `false` disables `prefs.arc @sandbox-startup` commands, which may be useful for local testing; thanks @reconbot!
- Added `env` option to API allowing programmatic control (add, replace, delete) of Lambda environment variables during automated testing, thanks @actsone8!
- Added internal Arc service mock for API Gateway Management API mock for managing WebSocket connections via `aws-sdk` calls; big thanks to @reconbot!


### Changed

- Sandbox will only ever print a given dependency issue one time, instead of upon each invocation
- Removed support for bare `port` CLI flag (e.g. `arc sandbox port 12345`); Sandbox now requires either `-p` or `--port` for setting the port from the CLI

---

## [4.2.3] 2021-11-02

### Changed

- Added warnings for macOS Monterey port conflicts on 5000 and 7000

---

## [4.2.2] 2021-10-20

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [4.2.üçÅ - 4.2.1] 2021-10-05

### Added

- Added Lambda context object with the following properties:
  - `awsRequestId` (Node.js), `aws_request_id` (Python / Ruby) - random GUID string, does not emulate AWS UUID4 request IDs
  - `functionName` (Node.js), `function_name` (Python / Ruby) - identifiable function name string prefixed by `sandbox-`; does not use live production AWS CFN GUIDs
  - `functionVersion` (Node.js), `function_version` (Python / Ruby) - will always be `$LATEST`
  - `invokedFunctionArn` (Node.js), `invoked_function_arn` (Python / Ruby) - always `sandbox`
  - `memoryLimitInMB` (Node.js), `memory_limit_in_mb` (Python / Ruby) - your Lambda's configured memory amount


### Fixed

- Restored `ARC_INTERNAL` env var in Lambda invocations for Arc Functions
- Restored userland env vars to `@sandbox-startup` scripts; thanks @reconbot!
- Fixed case where `@ws` with no `@http` or `@static` would fail to start up

---

## [4.1.1] 2021-09-30

### Changed

- Restored missing ARC_SANDBOX_PATH_TO_STATIC in Lambda env vars for manual ASAP use; fixes #1231, thanks @andybee!

---

## [4.1.0] 2021-09-15

### Added

- Sandbox now accepts a `apigateway` option, in addition to `@aws apigateway` and `ARC_API_TYPE` env var
  - As before, valid options include: `http` (default if not passed), `httpv1`, `rest`
- Sandbox can now be shipped as a binary via `pkg`
  - Added a new GitHub Actions workflow to per-platform build binary versions and run integration tests


### Changed

- Route list now shows automatic static asset delivery at the root as mounting the public folder
- Projects that don't define root handlers will now load static assets from the root much, *much* faster!
- Internal: refactor to remove use of environment variables for passing data or config to various internals services, most notably the Lambda execution environment; fixes #1222
  - Lambda executions' env vars are now completely pure and clean, having no extraneous host system env vars
  - Sandbox no longer mutates env vars (with the exception of `ARC_ENV` and `NODE_ENV` if unset or altered by preferences, such as `@sandbox useAWS`)
  - Clean up any non-essential reliance tests may have on env vars previously populated by Sandbox
  - Refactor tests to also stop mutating env vars, and to better clean up after themselves
- Internal: refactor to more cleanly and consistently pass common parameters around through critical code paths
- Added better support for `ARC_ENV` (instead of relying on / using `NODE_ENV`), helpful for improving reliability when running alongside certain other libraries that mutate `NODE_ENV`


### Fixed

- Fixed local symlinking issue introduced in 4.0.2


---

## [4.0.3 - 4.0.4] 2021-09-14

### Changed

- Internal: Updated Architect Parser to v5
- Updated dependencies

---

## [4.0.2] 2021-09-05

### Changed

- Update dependencies; resolve breaking changes from `ws@8.0.0`
- Improved invocation behavior for JS functions where non-async handlers returning a Promise should not fail, thanks @reconbot!
- Improved WebSocket behavior when responding with !`200`; messages now respond with an error message instead of failing silently, thanks @reconbot!


### Fixed

- Fixed CLI when parsing larger port numbers (e.g. `--port 33333`); fixes #1023, thanks @filmaj + LumaKernel!
- Fixed inconsistent error reporting, thanks @reconbot!
- Disable filesystem watching of node_modules and .git by default; fixes #1213
- Fixed WebSocket disconnect firing when Sandbox shuts down, thanks @reconbot!

---

## [4.0.0 - 4.0.1] 2021-07-22

### Changed

- Breaking change: removed support for Node.js 10.x (now EOL, and no longer available to create / update in AWS Lambda)
- Breaking change: removed support for Architect 5 (and lower)
  - This change in reality should not impact anyone, as Architect 5 LTS releases haven't used modern versions of Sandbox for quite some time
- Breaking change: removed internal tables lookup at `/_asd`, deprecated in favor of Sandbox's proper internal service discovery
- Removed deprecated `@sandbox startup` warning
- Update and tidy up dependencies

---

## [3.7.4] 2021-06-30

### Added

---

## [3.7.3] 2021-06-24

### Added

- Populate Sandbox startup commands (`prefs.arc` `@sandbox-startup`) with `ARC_INV` env var, providing access to the project's Inventory object


### Fixed

- Ensure Sandbox startup commands respect `cwd`

---

## [3.7.2] 2021-06-22

### Fixed

- Attempted to fix Sandbox not terminating processes properly when running in Lambda due to Lambda not having *nix `ps`
- Hardened process termination testing

---

## [3.7.0 - 3.7.1] 2021-06-14

### Added

- Added `cwd` API param, making it easier to run Sandbox against one or many mock project directories in tests
- Added `@ws` route printing


### Changed

- Stopped making unnecessary Inventory calls during Sandbox / services startup, Sandbox now starts 10-25% faster most of the time
- Purified tests, removing all `process.chdir` calls (except those essential for testing the actual inferred working directory)
- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where CLI might take a long time to reload local routes (or not reload them at all) due to [issues related to Node.js stalling while closing its http server](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2642)
- Fixed issue that could cause `sandbox.http.end()` and `sandbox.events.end()` to hang during tests
- Ensure plugin `invokeFunction` has all necessary params, fixes #1162
- Fixed issue where plugin functions might not be hydrated by Sandbox

---

## [3.6.0] 2021-05-24

### Added

  - `--quiet` (`-q`, `quiet`) - suppresses logging
  - `--verbose` (`v`, `verbose`) - additional Sandbox data related to your userland environment and invocations
  - `--debug` (`d`, `debug`) - debug Sandbox internals (handy for Sandbox development)


### Changed

- Cleaned up the output when triggering `@events` and `@queues` Lambdae


### Fixed

- Improved file watcher error logging and handling

---

## [3.4.3] 2021-05-05

### Fixed

- Undid change that unnecessarily added Inventory object to WS requests; fixes [#1121](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1121), thanks @pgte!
- Fixed an issue where Sandbox wouldn't kill a running Lambda if its configured timeout had expired, fixes [#1137](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1137), thanks @andybee!
- Sandbox will now print a warning to the console if any running Lambdas time out

---

## [3.4.2] 2021-04-19

### Fixed

- Sandbox now supports named `@indexes` (via the `name` parameter), fixes [#1122](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1122)

---

## [3.4.1] 2021-03-23

### Fixed

- Sandbox now works with an app composed of nothing but WebSockets, fixes [#1099](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1099)

---

## [3.2.2]

### Added

- Development instructions in the readme for those wanting to hack, test, and iterate on Sandbox locally

---

## [3.2.1] 2020-11-28

### Fixed

- Gracefully fail when Sandbox startup script does not supply sufficient arguments; partially fixes #1019, thanks @filmaj!

---

## [3.2.0] 2020-11-23

### Added

- Added support for custom file paths in all function types
- Added support for new local preferences (`preferences.arc` or `prefs.arc`) file
  - Add Sandbox preferences with `@sandbox`
    - `@env` (generated by running `arc env`, or added manually) populates environment variables
    - `create false` disables the local filesystem creator
  - Example:
```arc
@sandbox
create false # disables automatic function creation
startup
  echo 'Hi there!'
  npm run test
  node some/arbitrary/script.js

@env
testing
  AN_ENV_VAR somethingUseful
```
- Added `.env` support; thanks @wesbos!
- Added missing Lambda handler error, and made ever so slightly nicer the error message presentation


### Changed

- Breaking change on the Sandbox startup init script beta: existing startup scripts have replaced by startup preferences (`@sandbox startup`, see above)
  - `scripts/sandbox-startup.[js|py|rb]` must now be executable and callable from a shell via startup preferences (e.g. `node scripts/sandbox-startup.js`)
- Implemented Inventory (`@architect/inventory`)
- Removed legacy (and I do mean *legacy*) auto-initialization of `arc-sessions` table from Arc <5
  - Still initializing `{appname}-{env}-arc-sesssions` tables, though
- Added more (hopefully) helpful environment-related init logging:
  - Which environment is being loaded
  - Whether Sandbox found any env vars for the current environment
  - Whether Sandbox is using any live AWS infra (via prefs or `ARC_LOCAL`)
- Sandbox no longer creates missing Lambda resources by default; to reenable that, add to your preferences file:
```arc
@create
autocreate true
```


### Fixed

- Fixed wonky order of env population message printing in Sandbox

---

## [3.1.3] 2020-10-19

### Fixed

- Fixed weird side effects that can sometimes occur when toggling between symlink enabled/disabled with `@aws shared false` in a function config


### Changed

- Improved rehydration behavior in CLI when symlinking is enabled
- Removed unnecessary dependency accidentally added in 3.1.0

---

## [3.1.1 - 3.1.2] 2020-10-18

### Added

- Internal change: laid some groundwork in Lambda invoker for new customization coming via Inventory


### Fixed

- Fixed obscure false positive missing dependency warning when `src/shared` is symlinked, and something in `src/shared` requires a module that's assumed to be in the function, but not in `src/shared`. It's weird, I know, but it can happen!
- Fixed another obscure false positive missing dependency warning when `src/shared` is symlinked, and something in `src/shared` requires a module that's only found in `src/shared`, but not in the function itself. Maybe slightly less weird, but it can def happen!

---

## [3.1.0] 2020-10-15

### Added

- Added support for symlinking shared code into functions (`src/shared` and `src/views`), which vastly improves Sandbox performance
  - Large projects utilizing shared code will see a 10-50x performance improvement on startup, and changes to shared code are now instantly reflected across all local functions
  - To drop back into file-copying mode, invoke sandbox with `--disable-symlinks` (or if using Sandbox via API, pass `symlink: false` in your options object)
  - If you are using `@static fingerprint true`, you will see a symlinked `static.json` in your `src/shared` folder. Feel free to add it to your .gitignore; while it isn't hurting anything, it will be dealt with in a future release
  - Legacy Windows operating systems that don't support symlinking will continue to copy shared code upon startup like some kind of hethen
  - Shout out to @joliss!

---

## [3.0.4 - 3.0.5] 2020-10-12

### Changed

- 3x expansion of integration test coverage (572 to 1784 integration tests)
- Internal change: Refactored and better documented body parsing middleware predicates


### Fixed

- Sandbox now responds to requests to root with only `/:param` defined in `HTTP` APIs, fixes #981
- Improved root handling + ASAP fallthrough behavior
- Fixed obscure false negative for adding Arc Static Asset Proxy when `@http` contains a route that looks like `get /:hey/there`
- Fixed parsing of duplicate query string params in deprecated (Arc v5) mode
- Fixed shutdown errors when using an external local DB, thanks @herschel666!
- Fixed issue where default region may prevent connections to external local DB, thanks @exalted!
- Fixed issue where WebSocket send events may fail in `HTTP` mode, thanks @grncdr!
- Fixed issue where paths with a param and catchall (e.g. `/:item/*`) had malformed request payloads, fixes #983

---

## [3.0.0 - 3.0.3] 2020-10-08

### Added

- Added support for `@http` catchall syntax (e.g. `get /api/*`)
- Added support for `@http` `any` method syntax (e.g. `any /path`)
- Added support for `@http` `head` + `options` methods
- Added experimental support for `@proxy`
- Added basic `requestContext` to `REST` API requests

### Changed

- Breaking change: with the addition of `@http` `any` and `*`, default `get /` greedy catchall is now deprecated
  - To restore that behavior, either move your `get /` route to `any /*`, or just define a new `any /*` route
- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Merged in patch from `2.0.4` to fix projects with `@ws`

---

## [2.0.4] 2020-10-08

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where projects with `@ws` fail to start up, thanks @grncdr!

---

## [2.0.2 - 2.0.3] 2020-10-06

### Changed

- Removed startup notice regarding Sandbox defaulting to `HTTP` API emulation mode


### Fixed

- Fixed regression when using a non-Sandbox DynamoDB instance via the `ARC_DB_EXTERNAL` env var, thanks @herschel666 & @m-butler!

---

## [2.0.1] 2020-09-29

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [2.0.0] 2020-09-15

### Added

- Added support for API Gateway `HTTP` APIs (with v1.0 and v2.0 payload formats)
  - API type configuration:
    - Valid settings: `http` (default), `httpv2` (aliased to `http`), `httpv1`, and `rest`
    - `http` + `httpv2` uses the latest API Gateway payload format (v2.0)
      - If you'd like to use `HTTP` APIs with code authored for an existing `REST` API project, manually specify the v1.0 payload format with `httpv1`
    - Backwards compatibility for `REST` APIs is retained with `rest` setting
    - More info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html
  - Your API type can be specified in the Architect project manifest as `@aws apigateway {type}`, or with the `ARC_API_TYPE` env var
  - API Gateway `HTTP` APIs as the new default API type in Sandbox **may be a breaking change for local workflows with existing projects**
    - If so, per above, make sure you set to `REST` mode with `ARC_API_TYPE=rest` or add that configuration to your project manifest
    - Existing projects with API Gateway `REST` APIs will remain unchanged and will continue to deploy safely, even though Sandbox now defaults to `HTTP`
- Added unified service interface and nascent API for Sandbox modules
- Sandbox itself and its various service modules (`http`, `events`, and `tables`) now have a consistent API to improve using Sandbox in your test suites
  - All Sandbox module methods now accept an options object, and can either return a Promise (e.g. can be used in async/await), or accept an optional callback
  - Additionally, all Sandbox module methods now properly set their own environment variables, hydrate any necessary dependencies, and handle any other necessary service startup routines
  - `sandbox.start()` and `.end()` start and end all Sandbox services:
    - `sandbox.start(options[, callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
    - `sandbox.end([callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
  - `http.start()` and `.end()` starts and ends just the HTTP / WebSocket service:
    - `http.start(options[, callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
    - `http.end([callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
  - `events.start()` and `.end()` starts and ends just the event bus service:
    - `events.start(options[, callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
    - `events.end([callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
  - `tables.start()` and `.end()` starts and ends just the local DynamoDB service:
    - `tables.start(options[, callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
    - `tables.end([callback]) ‚Üí [Promise]`
- ~3x expansion of test coverage:
  - Integration test suite expanded by 3x (124 to 358 integration tests)
  - Unit test suite expanded by 2.5x (432 to 1,090 unit tests)


### Changed

- A number of seldom used and largely undocumented Sandbox module APIs have a number of breaking changes:
  - `sandbox.start()` no longer returns a function to shut down, and should now be shut down directly with `sandbox.end()`
  - `sandbox.db()` is now `sandbox.tables()`
  - `http.close()` is now `http.end()`
  - `events.start()` & `tables.start()` no longer return server objects to be invoked with `.close()`, and should now be shut down directly with `events.end()` and `tables.end()`


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where Lambda timeouts were only respected if >3 seconds; now >=1 second is valid
- Refactored Arc v6 response support for multiValueHeaders to better accommodate use cases where headers & multiValueHeaders are not in conflict with each other

---

- Fixed incorrect filename in proxy 404 error message
- Response headers are now remapped (and in some cases dropped) per observed behavior in API Gateway
  - Worth noting, this follows *actually observed* API Gateway behavior; what's published in their docs (link below) has been known to differ from reality
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-known-issues.html
  - Fixes #879; /ht @andybee

### Added

- Adds Yarn support for hydration
- Improved default caching behavior for static assets; fixes #273
  - Any assets that don't have `cache-control` explicitly set will now default to using `ETag` in order to improve the reliability of cache invalidation
  - HTML & JSON responses still default to anti-caching headers
- Added path peeking (aka pretty URLs)
  - Example: to load `/foo/index.html`, you used to have to request `/foo/`
- Added ETag support to Sandbox static asset serving

### Fixed

- Fixed `ERR_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE_ON_PLATFORM` error in Node.js 14; fixes #780, ht @stegosource

---

## [1.9.6] 2020-04-22

### Added

- Fixed `Deno.env()` became `Deno.env.toObject()` for the impending 1.x release

---

## [1.9.5] 2020-04-18

### Fixed

- Updated dependency status checker, fixes false positive rehyhdration of packages installed by archive or git repo

---

## [1.9.4] 2020-04-16

### Added

- Added Sandbox watcher pausing
  - The presence of `_pause-architect-sandbox-watcher` in your operating system's `$TMP` directory (usually `/tmp` or `c:\windows\temp`) will temporarily pause the Sandbox watcher
  - This is useful when combined with tools like `lint-staged` to ensure automated file stashing within `src/shared` and `src/views` doesn't result in hydration failures
  - Sandbox cleans up this file on startup, jic


### Changed

- Improved missing dependency warning to provide better instructions on how to install a missing dependency if the function in question does not already have a `package.json` file; /ht @exalted


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where explicit (or empty) returns would provide a red herring error
- When a non-existent `@events` Lambda is invoked, Sandbox will now gracefully fail

---

## [1.9.3] 2020-04-08

### Fixed

- Sandbox should now restore the terminal cursor more reliably when quit
- Preserve leading/trailing whitespace from console logging
- Fixed issue where `.arc-config` files with an `@aws timeout` value of exactly `900` (15 minutes) would not be respected

---

## [1.9.2] 2020-04-06

### Added

- Adds console logging for uncaught exceptions in async functions in Node.js and Deno; /ht @coco98


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Sandbox should now restore the terminal cursor more reliably when shut down

---

## [1.9.1] 2020-03-31

### Fixed

- Updated the call to start Sandbox in Architect 6 such that it will now actually initiate the filesystem watcher

---


## [1.9.0] 2020-03-29

### Added

- Adds warning for out of bounds dependency loads
  - This helps to ensure that potential side effects of running Node.js locally ‚Äì such as the `require` algorithm traversing the filesystem outside the boundaries of the function in question ‚Äì are less likely to be discovered after deploying to live AWS infra

---

## [1.8.2 - 1.8.3] 2020-03-24

### Added

- Lambda's payload size limits are now respected and mocked; payloads exceeding 6MB will fail to execute, as they would in AWS


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

---

## [1.8.1] 2020-03-22

### Changed

- Minor improvements to auto-generated boilerplate function files
- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- `.arc-env` env vars now support a wider variety of special characters (such as `+`, `@`, `#`, etc.) if quoted, e.g. `FOO "sp#ci@lch+rs"`; fixes #638
- Fixed Architect project manifest syntax errors and error reporting

---

## [1.8.0] 2020-03-18

### Added

- Added support for running without an existing Architect project manifest


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Query string arrays like `?ids=1&ids=2&ids=3&ids=4` are now consistent with API Gateway's request `multiValueQueryStringParameters` property
  - Previously, the array-like value was available as an object in `request.queryStringParameters` (and `request.query` in Arc 5 mode) which was inconsistent with API Gateway

---

## [1.7.3] 2020-03-17

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.7.2] 2020-02-29

### Added

- Added mocking of AWS's `multiValueHeaders` into `req`
- Also added mocking of the headers AWS drops from requests


### Fixed

- Fixes differences between AWS's inconsistent header casing and our existing lowcase-normalized header casing; fixes #698

---

## [1.7.1] 2020-02-13

### Changed
- Sandbox now ensures `NODE_ENV` is one of `testing`, `staging`, or `production` (defaulting to `testing`)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where pulling changes down with git (or Mercurial) would not trigger filesystem changes; fixes #673
- Improves reliability of using Sandbox with certain test harnesses that may automatically set `NODE_ENV`

---

## [1.7.0] 2020-02-05

### Added

- Added support for running multiple Sandboxes at the same time; fixes #635
  - No more conflicting events and ports when running multiple simultaneous local Architect projects
  - Also, you can now manually configure your `@events` port with `ARC_EVENTS_PORT`, and `@tables` port with `ARC_TABLES_PORT`
  - Note: while unlikely, if you already manually specify your Sandbox's port, this may be a breaking change to your local workflow in two circumstances:
    - 1) You use Architect Functions; to fix, upgrade to Functions `3.6` or later
    - 2) You hardcode an `@events` client to port `3334` or DynamoDB client to port `5000`; you should now read the ports from `ARC_EVENTS_PORT` and `ARC_TABLES_PORT`
    - This change is **NOT breaking to any live AWS / production infra**

---

## [1.6.1] 2020-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed AWS credential instantiation to ensure that missing `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars are backfilled with dummy values in scenarios where valid credentials are not required

---

## [1.6.0] 2020-02-02

### Added

- Better support for quiet mode:
  - Via params: `sandbox.start({quiet: true})`
  - Via env vars: `ARC_QUIET` (or legacy `QUIET`)
  - Fixes #621; thanks @konsumer!
- Adds discrete `sandbox.end([callback])` method for shutting down the Sandbox in test environments
  - This method takes an optional callback or returns a promise
- Sandbox now sets the `ARC_CLOUDFORMATION` env var used by Architect Functions and other libs
  - This only occurs when running Sandbox against live infra (specifically: `NODE_ENV` = `staging` || `production`),


### Changed

- When called as module, `sandbox.end` now calls an optional callback or returns a promise; fixes #622, thanks @konsumer!
- Sandbox now only starts the `@events` + `@queues` bus and `@tables` DB when called for by the Architect project manifest


### Fixed

- Improved logging for WebSocket invocations to be less confusing about potential non-error states when message action not found; fixes @sandbox#228
- Fixed potential destructuring bug in `sandbox.start`

---

## [1.5.8] 2020-01-29

### Added

- Sandbox now supports Deno runtime projects!

---

## [1.4.19] 2019-12-12

### Added

- Sandbox now passes full request params from WebSocket clients on `connect` and `disconnect`
  - Now in addition to `request.requestContext.connectionId`, you'll have `request.headers`, and `request.queryStringParameters` (if present)
  - Sandbox now only passes `request.body` to WebSocket functions that receive `message`s (instead of adding an empty `body` object to all requests)


### Changed

- Adds better backwards compatibility support for legacy `src/ws/ws-*` WebSocket function paths

---

## [1.4.18] 2019-12-10

### Added

---

## [1.4.7] 2019-10-14

### Changed

- Legacy WebSockets paths on the filesystem are now formally deprecated
  - Your default three WebSockets paths should be: `src/ws/default`, `src/ws/connect`, `src/ws/disconnect`
  - If you're using legacy WebSockets paths (either `src/ws/ws-default` or `src/ws/ws-$default`), simply remove `ws-[$]` and you should be all set!

## [1.4.4 - 1.4.5] 2019-10-10

### Added

- Added support for `@static fingerprint true` in root spa / proxy requests
  - Also includes support for build-free calls between your fingerprinted static assets
    - Example: in `public/index.html`, use the following syntax to automatically replace the local / human-friendly filename reference to the deployed fingerprinted filename:
    - `${arc.static('image.png')}` will be automatically replaced by `image-a1c3e5.png`
    - Or `${STATIC('image.png')}` (which is the same thing, but shoutier)
    - Note: although those look like JS template literal placeholders, they're intended to live inside non-executed, static files within `public/` (or `@static folder foo`)


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixes

- Fixes root spa / proxy requests when Architect and/or Sandbox are globally installed; resolves #92 /ht @grahamb

---

## [1.4.1 - 1.4.3] 2019-09-29

### Added

- Startup auto-hydration now hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- When auto-hydrating functions upon startup, `sandbox` no longer hydrates `src/views` and `src/shared` with each function

---

## [1.4.0] 2019-09-26

### Added

- Auto-hydration received a bunch of nice upgrades:
  - Auto-hydration now detects changes to the state of your installed Node dependencies, and rehydrates if necessary; for example:
    - You're working on a project, and a teammate updates a dependency in `get /foo` from version `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`
    - Upon your next git pull, `sandbox` will detect the dependency update in `get /foo` and automatically install version `1.1.0` for you
  - Auto-hydration now has a rate limit of one change every 500ms to prevent recursive or aggressive file updates
  - Auto-hydration now has `@static folder` support
  - Auto-hydration now only hydrates the shared files necessary
    - For example: if you change a file in `src/views`, it will only update your `@views` functions, and not attempt to rehydrate all your project's functions with `src/shared`
  - Events now have a timestamp and improved formatting
- Beta: `sandbox` init script support!
  - `sandbox` will now run the init script of your choosing upon startup after all subsystems have started up:
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.js` - a CommonJS module, receives your parsed Arc project as a parameter, supports async/await
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.py` - a Python script
    - `scripts/sandbox-startup.rb` - a Ruby script


### Changed

- Improvements to auto-hydration of `src/shared` and `src/views` upon startup
- Improvements to the conditions under which the HTTP server starts, shuts down, and restarts; fixes #65
- Improved async error copy (displayed when execution does not complete)
- Proxied requests now sends a proper `req.resource`, which can resolve some SPA bugs, esp when used with newer Arc Functions
- `sandbox` now respects and errors on invalid response params for proper Architect 6 compatibility; fixes #49
- Updates Dynalite to `3.0.0`, thanks @mhart!
- Better 404 / file missing handling in `sandbox` when using `http.proxy` (or loading assets without `@http get /` specified)


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where in certain circumstances `get /` wouldn't reload after a change to the project manifest
- Minor fix where if you specified a `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` env var outside of `.arc-env`, `sandbox` won't clobber it
- Fixed caching headers for various error states (async, timeout, etc.) to ensure your browser won't accidentally cache an error response

---

## [1.3.14] 2019-09-16

### Changed

- Internal change: moves vendored HTTP proxy bundle into node module
- This change incorporates a number of fixes by way of `@architect/functions` (see below)
