## API

### `sandbox.cli({ver}, callback)`

Invokes [`sandbox.start()`][start] to start a sandbox instance, passing the parameter object in. Then sets up a filesystem watcher for changes to:

1. Files within shared folders (`src/shared/, src/views/`, etc.), in which case it will re-[hydrate][hydrate] all functions with the new files, and
2. The Architect project manifest file, in which case it will re-start the HTTP server by calling into [`http()`][http].

Prints the specified `ver` on init, or falls back to the version string defined in this project's `package.json`.


### `sandbox.db.start(callback)`

Starts a singleton [local in-memory DynamoDB server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynalite), automatically creating any tables or indexes defined in the project manifest's [`@tables`][tables] pragma. Also creates a local session table.

Returns an object with a `close()` method that gracefully shuts the server down.

Invokes `callback` once the DB is up and listening.


### `sandbox.events.start(callback)`

If Architect project manifest defines [`@queues`][queues] or [`@events`][events], sets up interprocess communication between your events and queues via a tiny web server.

Returns an object with a `close()` method that gracefully shuts the server down.

Invokes `callback` once the server is up and listening.


### `sandbox.http.start(callback)`

If Architect project manifest defines defines [`@http`][http] or [`@websocket`][websocket] routes, starts the necessary servers and sets up routes as defined in the project manifest.

Invokes `callback` once the server is up and listening.


### `sandbox.http.close()`

Closes any servers started via [`sandbox.http.start()`][start].


### `sandbox.start({port, options}, callback)`

Initializes the sandbox; first checks that ports are available to consume, prints a banner, loading basic environment variables and necessary AWS credentials, and sets up any local DBs via [`sandbox.db.start()`][db], events or queues via [`sandbox.events.start()`][events-start], HTTP handlers via [`sandbox.http.start()`][http-start].

Invokes `callback` once everything is ready, passing `null` as the first parameter and `end` as the second parameter to `callback`, where `end` is a
function that closes all servers down.

Returns a promise if `callback` is falsy.
